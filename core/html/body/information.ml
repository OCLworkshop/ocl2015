        <p style="text-align:justify">Ottawa is the Capital of Canada and is accessible with direct flights
        from many US Cities, and also from London UK and Frankfurt. International
        attendees are urged to consider international flights landing in Ottawa. If
        you choose flights that land elsewhere in Canada (e.g. Toronto, Montreal,
        Vancouver) and then transfer to domestic flights to Ottawa, you will have
        to clear customs and immigration in the first city in which you land; this
        process includes collecting any checked baggage and then checking it again,
        so you should leave at least two hours of transfer time.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">For passengers leaving Ottawa, destined for US airports, you will go
        through US customs and immigration at the Ottawa airport on departure.</p>
