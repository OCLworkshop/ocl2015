Modeling started out with UML and its precursors as a graphical
notation. Such visual representations enable direct intuitive
capturing of reality, but some of their features are difficult to
formalize and lack the level of precision required to create complete
and unambiguous specifications. Limitations of the graphical notations
encouraged the development of text-based modeling languages that
either integrate with or replace graphical notations for
modeling. Typical examples of such languages are OCL, textual MOF,
Epsilon, and Alloy. Textual modeling languages have their roots in
formal language paradigms like logic, programming and databases.

The goal of this workshop is to create a forum where researchers and
practitioners interested in building models using OCL or other kinds
of textual languages can directly interact, report advances, share
results, identify tools for language development, and discuss
appropriate standards. In particular, the workshop will encourage
discussions for achieving synergy from different modeling language
concepts and modeling language use. The close interaction will enable
researchers and practitioners to identify common interests and options
for potential cooperation.
