                    CALL FOR PAPERS
    15th International Workshop on OCL and Textual Modeling
          Tools and Textual Model Transformations

   Co-located with ACM/IEEE 18th International Conference on
 Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS 2015)
       September 28th, 2015, Ottawa, Canada
                   http://ocl2015.lri.fr

Modeling started out with UML and its precursors as a graphical
notation. Such visual representations enable direct intuitive
capturing of reality, but some of their features are difficult to
formalize and lack the level of precision required to create complete
and unambiguous specifications. Limitations of the graphical notations
encouraged the development of text-based modeling languages that
either integrate with or replace graphical notations for
modeling. Typical examples of such languages are OCL, textual MOF,
Epsilon, and Alloy. Textual modeling languages have their roots in
formal language paradigms like logic, programming and databases.

The goal of this workshop is to create a forum where researchers and
practitioners interested in building models using OCL or other kinds
of textual languages can directly interact, report advances, share
results, identify tools for language development, and discuss
appropriate standards. In particular, the workshop will encourage
discussions for achieving synergy from different modeling language
concepts and modeling language use. The close interaction will enable
researchers and practitioners to identify common interests and options
for potential cooperation.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to)
===================================================
- Mappings between textual modeling languages and other languages/formalisms
- Algorithms, evaluation strategies and optimizations in the context
  of textual modeling languages for
  -- validation, verification, and testing,
  -- model transformation and code generation,
  -- meta-modeling and DSLs, and
  -- query and constraint specifications
- Alternative graphical/textual notations for textual modeling languages
- Evolution, transformation and simplification of textual modeling
  expressions
- Libraries, templates and patterns for textual modeling languages
- Tools that support textual modeling languages (e.g., verification of
  OCL formulae, runtime monitoring of invariants)
- Complexity results for textual modeling languages
- Quality models and benchmarks for comparing and evaluating
  textual modeling tools and algorithms
- Successful applications of textual modeling languages
- Case studies on industrial applications of textual modeling languages
- Experience reports
  -- usage of textual modeling languages and tools in complex domains,
  -- usability of textual modeling languages and tools for end-users
- Empirical studies about the benefits and drawbacks of textual modeling
  languages
- Innovative textual modeling tools
- Comparison, evaluation and integration of modeling languages
- Correlation between modeling languages and modeling tasks

This year, we particularly encourage submissions describing tools that
support - in a very broad sense - textual modeling languages (if you
have implemented OCL.js to run OCL in a web browser, this is the right
workshop to present your work) as well as textual model
transformations.

Venue
=====
The workshop will be organized as a part of MODELS 2015 Conference in
Ottawa, Canada. It continues the series of OCL workshops held at
UML/MODELS conferences: York (2000), Toronto (2001), San Francisco
(2003), Lisbon (2004), Montego Bay (2005), Genova (2006), Nashville
(2007), Toulouse (2008), Denver (2009), Oslo (2010), Zurich (2011, at
the TOOLs conference), 2012 in Innsbruck, 2013 in Miami, and 2014 in
Valencia, Spain. Similar to its predecessors, the workshop addresses
both people from academia and industry. The aim is to provide a forum
for addressing integration of OCL and other textual modeling
languages, as well as tools for textual modeling, and for
disseminating good practice and discussing the new requirements for
textual modeling.

Workshop Format
===============
The workshop will include short (about 15 min) presentations, parallel
sessions of working groups, and sum-up discussions.

Submissions
===========
Three types of papers will be considered:
* short papers (between 6 and 8 pages) describing ideas,
* tool papers (between 6 and 8 pages), and
* full papers (between 12 and 16 pages)
in LNCS format. Submissions should be uploaded to EasyChair
(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ocl20150).  The
program committee will review the submissions (minimum 2 reviews per
paper, usually 3 reviews) and select papers according to their
relevance and interest for discussions that will take place at the
workshop. Accepted papers will be published online in a
pre-conference edition of CEUR (http://www.ceur-ws.org).

Important Dates
===============
Submission of papers:      July 17, 2015
Notification:            August 21, 2015
Workshop date:        September 28, 2015
